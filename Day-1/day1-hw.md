**Homework: Advanced String Manipulation in Python**

### **Objective:**

By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

-   Understand and apply string operations and methods.

-   Perform string concatenation and manipulation.

-   Use f-strings and `.format()` for advanced string formatting.

-   Work with indexing, slicing, and string transformations.

### **Part 1: String Methods & Transformations**

1.  Create a variable `text` and assign it any paragraph of your choice (at least 3 sentences).

2.  Perform the following transformations and print the results:

    -   Convert the entire text to uppercase and lowercase.

    -   Capitalize only the first letter of the text.

    -   Count how many times a specific word appears in the text.

    -   Replace a specific word with another word.

    -   Remove all spaces from the text using `.replace()`.

    -   Check if the text starts with a specific word and ends with another word.

    -   Split the text into a list of words and print the list.

### **Part 2: String Concatenation & Manipulation**

1.  Create two string variables: `first_name` and `last_name`.

2.  Concatenate them with a space in between and store the result in a variable called `full_name`.

3.  Convert `full_name` to all uppercase and print it.

4.  Swap the first and last names and print the result.

5.  Create a new string where the first name is reversed and the last name is in title case.

### **Part 3: String Formatting & Dynamic Input**

1.  Ask the user to enter their name, age, and favorite programming language.

2.  Use an **f-string** to format and print the output:

    -   "Hello, my name is [Name], I am [Age] years old, and I love [Programming Language]."

3.  Use the `.format()` method to achieve the same output.

4.  Ensure that the name is always displayed in title case, regardless of how the user enters it.

### **Part 4: Indexing, Slicing & Reversing**

1.  Given the string `phrase = "Mastering Python is Fun!"`, perform the following:

    -   Print the first and last character of `phrase`.

    -   Extract the word "Python" using slicing.

    -   Extract every second character from the string.

    -   Reverse the entire string.

    -   Find and print the index of the word "Python" in the string.

### **Bonus Challenge:**

1.  Ask the user to input a sentence.

2.  Remove all vowels from the sentence and print the result.

3.  Reverse every word in the sentence while keeping the word order the same.

4.  Convert the sentence into a CamelCase format (e.g., "hello world" â†’ "HelloWorld").

5.  Print the most frequently occurring character in the sentence (excluding spaces).

**Submission:** Submit your Python script (.py file) or copy-paste the results along with the code into a document.
